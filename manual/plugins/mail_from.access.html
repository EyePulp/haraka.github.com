            <h1>mail_from.access</h1>

<p>This plugin will evaluate the address against a set of white and black lists.
The lists are applied in the following way:</p>

<p>mail<em>from.access.whitelist         (pass)
mail</em>from.access.whitelist<em>regex   (pass)
mail</em>from.access.blacklist         (block)
mail<em>from.access.blacklist</em>regex   (block)</p>

<h2>Configuration mail_from.access.ini</h2>

<p>General configuration file for this plugin.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>mail<em>from.access.general.deny</em>msg</p>

<p>Text to send the user on reject (text).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration mail_from.access.whitelist</h2>

<p>The whitelist is mostly to counter blacklist entries that match more than
what one would want.  This file should be used for a specific address,
one per line, that should bypass blacklist checks.
NOTE: We heavily suggest tailoring blacklist entries to be as accurate as
possible and never using whitelists.  Nevertheless, if you need whitelists,
here they are.</p>

<h2>Configuration mail<em>from.access.whitelist</em>regex</h2>

<p>Does the same thing as the whitelist file, but each line is a regex.
Each line is also anchored for you, meaning '^' + regex + '$' is added for
you.  If you need to get around this restriction, you may use a '.*' at
either the start or the end of your regex.  This should help prevent people
from writing overly permissive rules on accident.</p>

<h2>Configuration mail_from.access.blacklist</h2>

<p>This file should be used for a specific address, one per line, that should
fail on connect.</p>

<h2>Configuration mail<em>from.access.blacklist</em>regex</h2>

<p>Does the same thing as the blacklist file, but each line is a regex.
Each line is also anchored for you, meaning '^' + regex + '$' is added for
you.  If you need to get around this restriction, you may use a '.*' at
