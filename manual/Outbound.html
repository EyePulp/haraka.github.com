            <h1>Outbound Mail with Haraka</h1>

<p>A default installation of Haraka will queue outbound mail for delivery in the
queue directory. Those mails will be delivered to the appropriate MX record
for that domain. Mails are queued onto your disk, and will deal appropriately
with temporary failures to retry delivery later.</p>

<p>Outbound mails are defined as those that have set the <code>connection.relaying</code>
flag to <code>true</code> via a plugin. The simplest way of doing that is to use SMTP
AUTH, and have the client authenticate. For example using the <code>auth/flat_file</code>
plugin. However it is very simple to write a custom plugin to do this.</p>

<p>For statistics on outbound mail use the <code>process_title</code> plugin. See the
documentation for that plugin for details.</p>

<p>To flush the outbound queue (for temporary failed mails) hit the Haraka master
process with the SIGHUP signal (via the <code>kill</code> command line tool).</p>

<h2>Outbound Configuration Files</h2>

<h3>outbound.concurrency_max</h3>

<p>Default: 100. Specifies the maximum concurrent connections to make. Note that
if using cluster (multiple CPUs) then this will be multiplied by the number
of CPUs that you have.</p>

<h3>outbound.enable_tls</h3>

<p>Default: 0. Put a "1" in this file to enable TLS for outbound mail when the
remote end is capable of receiving TLS connections.</p>

<p>This uses the same <code>tls_key.pem</code> and <code>tls_cert.pem</code> files that the <code>tls</code>
plugin uses. See the plugin documentation for information on generating those
files.</p>

<h3>outbound.bounce_message</h3>

<p>See "Bounce Messages" below for details.</p>

<h3>outbound.disabled</h3>

<p>Allows you to temporarily disable outbound delivery, while still able to
receive and queue emails. This can be done while Haraka is running due to
how Haraka watches for config file changes.</p>

<h2>Outbound Mail Hooks</h2>

<h3>The queue_outbound hook</h3>

<p>The first hook that is called prior to queueing an outbound mail is the
<code>queue_outbound</code> hook. Only if all these hooks return <code>CONT</code> (or if there are
no hooks) will the mail be queued for outbound delivery. A return of <code>OK</code> will
indicate that the mail has been queued in some custom manner for outbound
delivery. Any of the <code>DENY</code> return codes will cause the message to be
appropriately rejected.</p>

<h3>The get_mx hook</h3>

<p>Upon starting delivery the <code>get_mx</code> hook is called, with the parameter set to
the domain in question (for example a mail to <code>user@example.com</code> will call the
<code>get_mx</code> hook with <code>(next, hmail, domain)</code> as parameters). This is to allow
you to implement a custom handler to find MX records. For most installations
there is no reason to implement this hook - Haraka will find the correct MX
records for you.</p>

<p>The MX record is sent via next(OK, mx) and can be one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A string of one of the following formats:
<ul>
<li>hostname</li>
<li>hostname:port</li>
<li>ipaddress</li>
<li>ipaddress:port</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An MX object of the form: <code>{priority: 0, exchange: hostname}</code> and optionally
a <code>port</code> value to specify an alternate port, and a <code>bind</code> value to specify an
outbound IP address to bind to.</li>
<li>A list of MX objects in an array, each in the same format as above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The bounce hook</h3>

<p>If the mail completely bounces then the <code>bounce</code> hook is called. This is <em>not</em>
called if the mail is issued a temporary failure (a 4xx error code). The hook
parameter is the error message received from the remote end. If you do not wish
to have a bounce message sent to the originating sender of the email then you
can return <code>OK</code> from this hook to stop it from sending a bounce message.</p>

<h3>The delivered hook</h3>

<p>When mails are successfully delivered to the remote end then the <code>delivered</code>
hook is called. The return codes from this hook have no effect, so it is only
useful for logging the fact that a successful delivery occurred.
This hook is called with <code>(hmail, response)</code> as parameters, the <code>response</code>
variable contains the SMTP response text returned by the host that received
the message and will typically contain the remote queue ID.</p>

<h2>Bounce Messages</h2>

<p>The contents of the bounce message are configured by a file called
<code>config/outbound.bounce_message</code>. If you look at this file you will see it
contains several template entries wrapped in curly brackets. These will be
populated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>pid - the current process id</li>
<li>date - the current date when the bounce occurred</li>
<li>me - the contents of <code>config/me</code></li>
<li>from - the originating sender of the message</li>
<li>msgid - a uuid for the mail</li>
<li>to - the end recipient of the message, or the first recipient if it was to
multiple people</li>
<li>reason - the text from the remote server indicating why it bounced</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the bounce message itself will be a copy of the entire original
message.</p>

<h2>Creating a mail internally for outbound delivery</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to generate a new mail from within a plugin.</p>

<p>To do that, you can use the <code>outbound</code> module directly:</p>

<pre><code>var outbound = require('./outbound');

var plugin = this;

var to = 'user@example.com';
var from = 'sender@example.com';

var contents = [
    "From: " + from,
    "To: " + to,
    "MIME-Version: 1.0",
    "Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii",
    "Subject: Some subject here",
    "",
    "Some email body here",
    ""].join("\n");

var outnext = function (code, msg) {
    switch (code) {
        case DENY:  plugin.logerror("Sending mail failed: " + msg);
                    break;
        case OK:    plugin.loginfo("mail sent");
                    next();
                    break;
        default:    plugin.logerror("Unrecognised return code from sending email: " + msg);
                    next();
    }
};

outbound.send_email(from, to, contents, outnext);
</code></pre>

<p>The callback on <code>send_email()</code> is passed <code>OK</code> if the mail is successfully
queued to disk, not when it is successfully delivered. To check delivery
status you still need to hook <code>delivered</code> and <code>bounce</code> to know if it was
successfully delivered.</p>

<p>The callback parameter may be omitted if you don't need to handle errors
should queueing to disk fail e.g:</p>

<pre><code>outbound.send_email(form, to, contents);
</code></pre>

        </div>
    </body>
